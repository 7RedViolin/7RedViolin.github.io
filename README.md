# Welcome to 7RedViolin's homepage!

New to cyber security things - here I'll practice CTF write-ups, create reviews/tutorials of tools I've worked with, and other random things I come across in my studies.

My primary focus will be digital forensics and open source intelligence but I may dabble in red team/penetration testing and programming code here and there. We'll just have to see what happens! I'm excited to see where this takes me :)
