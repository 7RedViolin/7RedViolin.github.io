## Objective: Now Hiring!
> What is the secret access key for the Jack Frost Tower job applications server?

In this challenge, we're given an form page to exploit and the hint of AWS EC2.

There's several fields we need to fill out but the one of interest is the URL since that brings to mind SSRF (server-side request forgery) attacks. In a nutshell, SSRF allows you to specify a URL in a webform that is then evaluated by the backend/internal server with the results being returned without any requirement for authentication. This vulnerability can leak sensitive information such as credentials or account secrets.

It took some trial and error but I soon learned I had to use Burp Suite to be able to see the full response. Also, the `name` field had to be set to `secret` or `access` or I wouldn't get any response.

Based on the documentation for AWS metatdata access, my first URL to target was `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/info` (or `http://[fd00:ec2::254]/latest/meta-data/iam/info` for IPv6) to pull all the available roles.

Then, based on the response, the next URL to get the actual secret was `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/jf-deploy-role`.
